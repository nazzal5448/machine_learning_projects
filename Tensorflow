# TensorFlow Projects

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the TensorFlow Projects directory within the Machine Learning Projects repository! This section focuses specifically on projects implemented using the TensorFlow library. Here, you'll find a collection of machine learning projects, accompanying Jupyter notebooks, and datasets used in each project.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

The TensorFlow Projects directory is structured as follows:

```
ðŸ“¦ tensorflow-projects-repo
 â”— ðŸ“‚ tensorflow
   â”£ ðŸ“‚ project-1
   â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ dataset
   â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚ notebooks
   â”£ ðŸ“‚ project-2
   â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ dataset
   â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚ notebooks
   â”— ðŸ“‚ project-3
     â”£ ðŸ“‚ dataset
     â”— ðŸ“‚ notebooks
```

Each project within the TensorFlow directory consists of the following components:

- ðŸ“‚ **dataset**: This directory holds the datasets used in the project. Detailed information about each dataset can be found within this folder.
- ðŸ“‚ **notebooks**: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the implementation and usage of TensorFlow models for the specific project. These notebooks serve as a starting point for your exploration and experimentation.
