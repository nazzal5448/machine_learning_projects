# Machine Learning Projects Repository

👋 Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects and practice notebooks that I've coded during my learning journey. The projects are implemented using popular libraries such as **Scikit-learn** and **TensorFlow**, along with fundamental libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
📦 machine-learning-projects-repo
 ┣ 📂 scikit-learn
 ┃ ┣ 📂 classification
 ┃ ┗ 📂 regression
 ┗ 📂 tensorflow
   ┣ 📂 classification
   ┗ 📂 regression
```

Within each section, the projects are further divided based on their type: **classification** and **regression**. This structure helps you easily navigate through the repository and find the projects of interest to you.
