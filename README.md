# Machine Learning Projects Repository

👋 Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects and practice notebooks that I've coded during my learning journey. The projects are implemented using popular libraries such as **Scikit-learn** and **TensorFlow**, along with fundamental libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
📦 machine-learning-projects-repo
 ┣ 📂 scikit-learn
 ┃ ┣ 📂 classification
 ┃ ┗ 📂 regression
 ┗ 📂 tensorflow
   ┣ 📂 classification
   ┗ 📂 regression
   ┗ 📂 tarnsfer_learning
```

Within each section, the projects are further divided based on their type: **classification** and **regression** and also on the basis of the concepts like **Feature Extraction** etc. This structure helps you easily navigate through the repository and find the projects of interest to you.

## 🚀 Scikit-learn Projects

### Classification

#### This section is empty for now.

### Regression

#### 🌟 Project 1: Bulldozer price prediction
📝 **Description:** The common regression project where bulldozer prices are predicted using scikit-learn.

## 🚀 TensorFlow Projects

### Introduction:
📝 **Description:** This contains an introductory notebook to deep learning and tensorflow and a small project at the end of notebook.

### Classification

#### 🌟 Project 1: Computer Vision
📝 **Description:** This contains a notebook on computer vision. First introduction and then a project.

#### 🌟 Project 2: Dog Vision
📝 **Description:** A very common classification of dogs into their breeds.

#### 🌟 Project 3: Fashion Mnist
📝 **Description:**  I have worked on`fashion_mnist` dataset and created a deep learning model for it.

#### 🌟 Project 4: Excercise
📝 **Description:**  Contains a practice notebook where I have practiced on a classification dataset.

### Regression

#### 🌟 Project 1: Insurance
📝 **Description:** Contains a notebook where I have worked on the kaggles's insurance dataset and developed a model for it. 

#### 🌟 Project 2: Exercise
📝 **Description:** Contains a practice notebook where I have developed a model for `california_housing` dataset

### Transfer Learning
📝 **Description:** Contains my practice notebooks in parts.

#### 🌟 Part 1: Feature Extraction:
📝 **Description:** Contains a notebook on transfer_learning's concept **Feature Extraction**.
   **Exercise** where i have tried a model on `food` and have tried `ResNet_152` on my custom dataset.
