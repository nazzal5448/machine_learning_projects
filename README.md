# TensorFlow Projects Repository

👋 Welcome to my TensorFlow Projects repository! This repository contains various machine learning projects implemented using TensorFlow, along with the datasets used and accompanying Jupyter notebooks. Each project is organized in a separate directory, making it easy to navigate and explore.

## Note: Please note that I'm currently learning and I have done all these projects for my practice purposes. So it may also contain my courses exercises.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
📦 tensorflow-projects-repo
 ┣ 📂 project-1
 ┃ ┣ 📂 dataset
 ┃ ┣ 📂 notebooks
 ┃ ┗ 📜 README.md
 ┣ 📂 project-2
 ┃ ┣ 📂 dataset
 ┃ ┣ 📂 notebooks
 ┃ ┗ 📜 README.md
 ┗ 📂 project-3
   ┣ 📂 dataset
   ┣ 📂 notebooks
   ┗ 📜 README.md
```

Each project has its own dedicated directory, which contains the following components:

- 📂 **dataset**: This directory holds the datasets used in the project. You will find detailed information on each dataset within this folder.
- 📂 **notebooks**: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the implementation and usage of TensorFlow models for the specific project. These notebooks serve as a starting point for your exploration and experimentation.
- 📜 **README.md**: The README file within each project directory provides specific information about the project, including its objectives, techniques used, and any additional instructions.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started, simply clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tensorflow-projects-repo.git
```

Ensure that you have TensorFlow installed in your environment. If not, you can install it by following the instructions in the official [TensorFlow documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/install). Additionally, some projects may require additional libraries or dependencies, which will be mentioned in their respective README files.
